        <div><h3>STEP 1. Choose a data set</h3>
<p>After studying the the list of indicators in Gapminder World
(https://www.gapminder.org/data/), I have decided to make cross-country
comparisons in regards to the mortality of children under the age of 5.</p>
<p>As the indicators are in different data files I will have to merge the
relevant data into one dataset and modify some of the original variable
names.
 </p>
<h3>STEP 2. Identify a specific topic of interest</h3>
<p>Research question: What is the correlation between child mortality and
female education?
 </p>
<h3>STEP 3. Prepare a codebook</h3>
<p>My codebook contains the following Gapminder variables:</p>
<p><em>Indicator name:</em> <strong>Under Five Mortality</strong><br />
<em>Description of Indicator (by Unicef):</em> The probability that a child
born in a specific year will die before reaching the age of five if
subject to current age-specific mortality rates. Expressed as a rate per
1,000 live births (2010).<br />
<em>Source organization(s):</em> CME info estimates, Human Mortality Database,
Estimated from Gapminder's IMR series, Data extrapolated back to 1800
based on Gapminder Life Expectancy combined with model life tables,
Other guesstimates</p>
<p><em>Indicator name:</em> <strong>Mean years in school (women of reproductive age, 15
to 44)</strong><br />
<em>Description of Indicator:</em> The average number of years of school
attended by all people in the age and gender group specified, including
primary, secondary and tertiary education (2009).<br />
<em>Source organization(s):</em> Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
 </p>
<h3>STEP 4. Identify a second topic</h3>
<p>I also want to look at other variables that may affect child mortality
rates of different countries. Does it depend on other factors such as
total expenditure on health? Is GDP reflecting the anticipated level of
child mortality?
 </p>
<h3>STEP 5. Additions to my personal codebook</h3>
<p><em>Indicator name:</em> <strong>incomeperperson</strong><br />
<em>Description of Indicator:</em> 2010 Gross Domestic Product per capita in
constant 2000 US\$. The inflation but not the differences in the cost of
living between countries has been taken into account.<br />
<em>Source organization(s):</em> World Bank Work Development Indicators</p>
<p><em>Indicator name:</em> <strong>Per capita total expenditure on health at average
exchange rate (US\$)</strong><br />
<em>Description of Indicator:</em> Per capita total expenditure on health
expressed at average exchange rate for that year in US\$. Current prices
(2010).<br />
<em>Source organization(s):</em> World Health Organization
 </p>
<h3>STEP 6. Literature Review</h3>
<p><strong>Search strings:</strong> child mortality, under-5, child survival, maternal
education, health expenditures</p>
<p>„With declining poverty and increasing knowledge and service in the
health sector, child mortality around the world is declining very
rapidly… Over the last decade this improvement has been happening faster
than ever before. Rising prosperity, rising education and the spread of
health care around the globe are the major drivers of this progress.”<br />
„As one would expect, income level of the country is extremely
correlated with child mortality rate. The poorest countries have the
highest levels of child mortality, and the countries with the highest
income have the lowest rates.” [1]</p>
<p>Gakidou et al. find that over half the decline seen in child mortality
globally between 1970-2010 can be explained by improvements in the
education of women. They also find that economic growth (GDP) can only
explain a very small amount of the reduction in child mortality. [2]</p>
<p>In their publication in the American Economic Journal the authors report
that improved access to medical services could improve the large
disparities in infant mortality rates both across and within countries.
[3]</p>
<p>According to Filmer and Pritchett health spending is not a powerful
determinant of mortality, 95% of cross-national variation in mortality
can be explained by a country’s income per capita, inequality of income
distribution, extent of female education, level of ethnic fragmentation,
and predominant religion. [4]</p>

<h3>STEP 7. Develop a hypothesis</h3>
<p><strong>My hypothesis:</strong> greater education for women is an important factor in
reducing the rate of death among children younger than five. Women with more education tend to have smaller families, have better
employment opportunities and more knowledge about parenatal care,
hygiene, nutrition.</p>
<p>I am curious to find out whether public spending on health really has a
significant effect, and how the income level of countries correlates
with child mortality.</p></div>
